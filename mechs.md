* Most modern keyboards use a membrane dome switch, which consists of a rubber membrane holding the key cap up, when you depress the keycap a metal plate on the membrane makes a connection with a metal plate on the board.
* Standard travel distance: 3.4-4mm

* Scissor switches are a special case of the membrane dome switch, with a plastic scissor mechanism linking the keycap to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome.
* travel distance ~ 2mm

* The switches under the keycaps are what makes a mechanical keyboard "mechanical"

* Each switch under the board is individual.

* switches are composed of: a base, a spring, and a stem
